# Release Checklist — Lunima

> Complete the list before every release. Copy it into the release issue, tick items off, and link any failing item to a follow-up issue.
>
> Verification: `auto` = covered by a named test; `manual` = needs a human with the UI. Unmarked items default to `manual`.

## Maintenance rule

Every PR that adds, removes, or materially changes a user-facing feature must update this file. Reviewers should check that the relevant checkbox is present and the expected result still matches the merged behavior.

## How to use at release time

1. Open a release issue / draft PR and paste the checklist below into it.
2. Walk through every manual item in a fresh build on each supported OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) where feasible.
3. Tick an item only after you have observed the expected result.
4. If a manual item fails, file a blocker issue and do not ship the release.
5. For `auto` items, rely on CI unless you touched the related area — then re-run the named tests locally.
