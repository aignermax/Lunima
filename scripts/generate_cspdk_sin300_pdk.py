"""Generate (and re-generate/update) the Lunima **CornerStone SiN-300** PDK JSON from
gdsfactory's open-source `cspdk` library — issue #570 follow-up / gdsfactory-backend PDKs.

This is the PDK's *updater*: the CornerStone process is a Python library (cspdk); when it
changes, re-run this to regenerate the Lunima PDK JSON. No hand-editing, no fabricated data.

Environment (cspdk >= 1.4.4 — 1.4.2's `coupler` cell raises on a `bend_s` kwarg, 1.4.3
lacks the CLAD_OPEN layer; sax ~0.17 matches cspdk's model kwargs; installed --no-deps to
avoid the unused gplugins/gdstk chain):

    uv venv .cspdk --python 3.12
    uv pip install --python .cspdk "gdsfactory==9.43.0" "sax~=0.17.0"
    uv pip install --python .cspdk --no-deps "cspdk==1.4.4"
    .cspdk/Scripts/python scripts/generate_cspdk_sin300_pdk.py CAP-DataAccess/PDKs/cornerstone-sin-pdk.json

Emits a `backend: "gdsfactory"` PDK: each component carries its gdsfactory factory name
(`gdsFactoryFunction = "cspdk.sin300.<cell>"`) instead of a `nazcaFunction`, so it exports via
the gdsfactory path and is skipped by the nazca-export tests. Geometry + pins are real
(`c.dbbox()` / `c.ports`); S-matrices come from cspdk's own `sax` compact models (#665). The
process fingerprint (Si3N4 / 300 nm / SiO2 / 1550 nm) makes it a distinct process from the
220 nm SOI PDKs for the single-process rule (#570).
